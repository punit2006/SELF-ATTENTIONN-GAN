A PyTorch implementation of Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (SAGAN) with experiment tracking using Weights & Biases. This implementation enhances traditional GANs by incorporating self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in images.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Self-Attention layers in both Generator and Discriminator
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset (64x64 color images)
- Global average pooling for discriminator stability
- Model saving/loading capabilities
- Integrated with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Visualization tools for generated samples

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train the model:
```python
python self_attentionn_gan.py
```

3. Generate samples:
```python
# After training, use the saved generator
generator = Generator(latent_dim=100)
generator.load_state_dict(torch.load("generator.pth"))
generator.eval()

# Generate 16 samples
noise = torch.randn(16, 100, 1, 1)
fake_images = generator(noise)
```
